# RedFox Studios 2D Game Engine

This project is a lightweight game engine created as a **JavaScript file** to simplify and speed up 2D web game development. If you‚Äôve ever struggled with repetitive, 300+ line JavaScript setups for each game project (like I have üòÖ), this engine aims to change that. By centralizing core game logic and controls, you can now build new games with separate scripts for game-specific mechanics.

## About the Project

This engine is designed for **RedFox Studios web game projects** and provides the essential tools for creating, running, and managing 2D games with minimal setup. With a focus on flexibility, it allows you to plug in individual game scripts, keeping your code clean and organized.

> **Note**: This project is currently private but will be made open-source in the future to benefit the dev community! üåê

## Features

- **Simple Setup**: Just include the engine and focus on creating game-specific scripts.
- **Efficient**: Reduces repetitive code across projects, making development faster.
- **Modular**: Supports multiple games with individual scripts.
- **Ideal for 2D Games**: Tailored for classic 2D web games, making it a perfect fit for quick, engaging browser-based experiences.

## Getting Started

Currently, this project is not open to the public. Stay tuned for updates as we plan to release it open-source for anyone interested in web game dev!
